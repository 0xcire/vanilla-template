# Vanilla Template

### Tools

- Vite
- Eslint (AirBnb Style Guide)
- Prettier

### notes

Configs are set up with vscode default settings in mind so you may need to extend to fit your environment.

An error may pop up regarding eslint not being able to find 'eslint-plugin-prettier'

Was able to resolve this by restarting the eslint server (in VSCode).
